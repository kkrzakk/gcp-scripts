# gcp-scripts

Here I'll gather all GCP-related scripts I wrote.

Channel_to_policy.py - add/remove notification channels from alert policies
get_instance_name.py - extract GCE instance name from api path
get_creators.py      - get creators for projects specified in file
get_projects.py      - get all projects for specified organization
users_by_role.py     - get all users with a specified role for all projects in the file, it also creates a file with a project with no such users

Next steps:
modify last 3 scripts so they would accept file name as arguments
