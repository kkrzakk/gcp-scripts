# gcp-scripts

**Here I'll gather all GCP-related scripts I wrote.**

* __Channel_to_policy.py__ - add/remove notification channels from alert policies  
* __get_instance_name.py__ - extract GCE instance name from api path  
* __get_creators.py__      - get creators for projects specified in file  
* __get_projects.py__      - get all projects for specified organization  
* __users_by_role.py__     - get all users with a specified role for all projects in the file, creates also a file with projects with no such users  
  
Next steps:  
modify last 3 scripts so they would accept file name as arguments
